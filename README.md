# Selenium Java Automation Project

Welcome to the Selenium Java automation project, developed as part of the course by trainer Rahul Shetty on Udemy. This project focuses on automating tests for an e-commerce website provided by Rahul Shetty's academy for practice.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes Selenium WebDriver with Java to automate tests for various functionalities of the e-commerce website. The tests are organized using the Page Object Model (POM), with each page of the website represented by a linked page class in the project. TestNG is used for test execution and reporting, and Extent Reports are generated to provide detailed test reports.

## Features

- **Page Object Model (POM):** Each page of the website has its corresponding page class in the project, facilitating easy maintenance and readability of tests.
  
- **TestNG XML Configuration:** TestNG XML files are used to group and execute tests, allowing for flexible test execution and configuration.
  
- **Extent Reports:** Detailed HTML reports are generated after test execution, providing comprehensive insights into test results and execution status.

- **Screenshot Capture on Failure:** In case of test failures, screenshots are automatically captured and included in the test reports for better error diagnosis.

- **Test Data Management:** The project includes a "validData.txt" file in the "others" folder, which contains valid data used in test cases. Additionally, a "url_pages.txt" file is provided, listing the URLs for each page specified in the test cases.

- **Exported Test Cases:** Test cases were created using the Qase website and exported in HTML format. They can be found in the Test Suites folder.
